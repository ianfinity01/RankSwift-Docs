In this example usage tutorial, we will be setting up a leaderboard that will do the following:

- View the top **25** users
- Let users view the **10** users before and after them
- Allow users to see their rank
- Update a player's score from a leaderstats NumberValue.

We will do this with a ServerScript, a surface gui on a part, some RemoteEvents, and a LocalScript. If you want to follow along, here is a place file with everything except for the code we're about to write: [TutorialPlace.rbxl](../../assets/TutorialPlace.rbxl){:download="TutorialPlace.rbxl"}.

We'll get started with the [ServerScript](./serverscript.md).
